                                 Complete as many lower division major requirements as possible.  See details on preparation for this major below.Primary selection criteria for admission, in general:                   - completion of L&S Requirements (or IGETC), plus                              - strength of academic preparation, and  
                                      - grade point average.                                                          For more information on admission to UC Berkeley:  
                     http://admissions.berkeley.eduFor more information on majors at UC Berkeley:                       Berkeley Academic Guide: http://guide.berkeley.eduPROGRAMPROGRAMPROGRAMAdvice regarding courses in computer science:                            The Computer Science department at Berkeley recognizes the fact that courses comparable to Berkeley's Computer Science 61A-61B-61C series are difficult to find at most community colleges. With few exceptions, transfer students must take COMPSCI 61A during their first semester at Berkeley.                        To be competitive for admission purposes, the department advises prospective transfer students to take UC-transferable courses in:                           1) All equivalent Mathematics prerequisites:  Math 1A, Math 1B, and Math 54.  2) Data structures--even if not officially comparable to Berkeley's COMPSCI 61B; and3) Java (preferred) or C++.           The entire Computer Science 61 series is also offered during the Berkeley Summer session.  The department recommends that, when possible, students take one of these courses during the summer session prior to transfer.If admitted, transfer students must achieve a 3.30 cumulative GPA in those remaining prerequisite courses (CS 61A, CS 61B, and CS 70) taken at UC Berkeley in order to petition for admission to the major.COMPSCI 61BAny course/s approved as comparable to COMPSCI 61B must include coverage of object-oriented programming, hashing, heaps, priority queues and graphs, together with at least one programming assignment of 1000 or more lines of code. If any of these topics are missing, the missing material may be acquired by taking a bridge course, COMPSCI 47B, at Berkeley. If you see "Articulation subject to completion of a university course'" below the community college course, then in addition to completing the community college course, you must complete COMPSCI 47B after enrollment at UC Berkeley. COMPSCI 70COMPSCI 70 is offered during the Berkeley Summer session or Concurrent Enrollment. RECOMMENDEDMath 53 is not required for the major. Completion of a Math 53 equivalent would waive 3 units of upper-division tech electives for the major. SERIES/SEQUENCE ARTICULATIONUnless the course equivalents are separately specified, do not assume that a sequence can be divided. If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., English 1A + 1B + 1C = English R1A and R1B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must be completed at the same community college in order to ensure that you have satisfied the requirement.For more information:                                                   Center for Student Affairs-CS Advising Office                                  (510) 642-7214/664-4436                                                        cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu
